This library converts potentially very big integers and fractions into
their text representation. At this time, only conversion to french
cardinal and ordinal is supported.


Example:
(number-to-french -132894362727827234/19837298127)
==> "moins cent trente-deux billiards huit cent quatre-vingt-quatorze billions trois cent soixante-deux milliards sept cent vingt-sept millions huit cent vingt-sept mille deux cent trente-quatre dix-neuf milliards huit cent trente-sept millions deux cent quatre-vingt-dix-huit mille cent vingt-septiÃ¨me"


API

output the result to STREAM and return undefined values.


Function: number-to-french-ordinal number &optional stream

Spell out NUMBER in French, as an ordinal number.

If STREAM is NIL (the default), return the result as a string. Else,

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

There's no support for feminine gender and plural form at this time.
Ex: (format nil "~A oranges." (number-to-french 21))
=> "vingt et un oranges." instead of "vingt et unes oranges."
Also, (number-to-french 21/2) => "vingt et un demie" instead of "vingt et unes demies".
